# Challenge 2 - Play Fetch Unity Project

This repository contains a small Unity project created for the "Challenge 2" tutorial series. It demonstrates basic scripting concepts such as object spawning, movement, collision detection and simple game logic. The scene shows balls falling from the top of the screen while the player can launch dogs to intercept them.

> **Note:** This project folder came from a Unity tutorial, so many of the assets/scripts are minimal and meant to teach beginners.

## 📝 Overview

- **Engine:** Unity (2020.x / 2021.x and later should work)
- **Language:** C#
- **Scenes:**
  - `Assets/Scenes/Challenge 2.unity` – the tutorial level with the gameplay.
  - `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity` – default empty sample scene generated by Unity.
- **Key scripts:** located under `Assets/Challenge 2/Scripts`
  - `SpawnManagerX` – spawns random balls at intervals.
  - `PlayerControllerX` – instantiates dog prefabs when the spacebar is pressed.
  - `MoveForwardX` – moves objects forward at a constant speed.
  - `DetectCollisionsX` – destroys objects on trigger contacts.
  - `DestroyOutOfBoundsX` – removes objects that move outside the playable area.
- **Utility:** `Assets/TutorialInfo/Scripts/Readme.cs` and accompanying editor script provide an in‑Editor README display when the project is opened.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity Editor (2020.3 LTS or later recommended)
- Git (if you plan to clone the repository)

### Opening the project

1. Clone or download this repository to your machine.
2. Launch the Unity Editor and choose **Open**.
3. Browse to the folder containing `Assets`, `ProjectSettings`, etc. and open it.
4. Allow Unity to import assets; this may take a few minutes on first load.

### Running the scene

- Open the scene `Assets/Scenes/Challenge 2.unity` from the **Project** window.
- Press the **Play** button in the Editor to start the game.
- Press **Space** during play mode to spawn a dog and try to hit the falling balls.

## 🎮 Controls

| Input    | Action              |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Spacebar | Launch a dog prefab |

There is no UI or scoring system in this tutorial build; `Debug.Log` prints "Game Over" when a ball falls past the bottom limit.
